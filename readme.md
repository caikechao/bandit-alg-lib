# Some bandit algorithms in MATLAB

## List of Algorithms

### LExp

See details in `Policy_LExp.m`
    
### UCB

See details `Policy_UCB.m`

### Exp3.M

See details in `Policy_EXP3M.m`

### MESI 

(to be released)

## Extension

- Inherit the `Arm` class to create new arms
- Inherit the `Policy` class to create new policies

## Note
  * Test the script by running `main.m`
  * This scripts do *not* implement the time-varying rewards.
  * Tested on MATLAB 2016b and MATLAB 2017b.
